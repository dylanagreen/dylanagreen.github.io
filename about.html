        My name is Dylan Green, and I am currently an Astrophysics graduate student at the University of California, Irvine.

        In my free time I engage in a variety of hobbies, most of which suspiciously seem to start with the letter `p`.
        One of my primary hobbies is programming. The largest and most expansive project I've written or worked on is by
        far my chess engine, <a href="https://github.com/dylanagreen/chrysaora">Chrysaora.</a>
        Chrysaora is written in a relatively new programming language called Nim, and uses
        a neural network composed of fully connected layers that are trained using reinforcement learning. This means that
        in theory it should get better at playing chess after every game, although currently the input parameters are
        of too broad a scope to support high level chess play. If you have a chance and it's online, be sure to play
        against it on <a href="https://lichess.org/@/PatientJellyfish">lichess.</a>
      </p><p>
        Most of my free time is otherwise dedicated to my podcasts, all of which can be found at
        <a href="http://decorativevegetable.com/">decorativevegetable.com.</a>
        My cohost and I release weekly episodes about Doctor Who as well as classic Science Fiction television. We
        use a rather liberal definition of "classic," generally taking it to refer to anything pre-21st century. It's
        great fun and both of us take pride in the shows, and if we've made at least one person laugh then we've succeeded.
      </p><p>
        If time permits I also engage in some analog photography, which means I shoot photos on 35mm film. I use a Canon
        FtB, and generally shoot whatever film I have available. The photo to the right of the Mayall 4-meter was taken
        on Ultramax 400 during my observing shift in December of 2019. I pretty much peaked at that moment. The photos
        I think are passable (and there are few), make their home at my
        <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/185938877@N04/"">flickr account.</a> The self portrait on my home page
        is another example of my photography.
      </p><p>
        Hobbies that do not necessarily have a web home but that I enjoy, and would love to discuss with anyone interested include
        philately (the study and collection of stamps) and watching an inordinate amount of movies. During quarantine I've
        been watching a movie a day, so rest assured I can talk about nearly any movie. Nearly. And that's about it! Now
        you know all about me.
