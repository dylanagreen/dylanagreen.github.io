As an undergraduate I joined the <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/dkirkby/">Kirkby lab</a>. My research worked with all-sky images that were taken at Kitt Peak National Observatory. I developed a convolutional neural network &#40;CNN&#41; to identify clouds that were moving towards and over the Mayall telescope. The results of this work can be seen in my repo <a href="https://github.com/dylanagreen/kpno-allsky">kpno-allsky</a>.</p> <p>As a graduate student I have remained in the Kirkby lab at UCI, where my current research focuses on using deep learning to develop data analysis pipelines. As part of the Kirkby lab I am also a part of both the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument &#40;DESI&#41; survey and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time &#40;LSST&#41; / Dark Energy Science Collaboration &#40;DESC&#41;. My first project aimed to use deep learning to identify and flag cosmic rays that appear in spectroscopic images taken for the DESI Survey. Additionally I wrote and maintain the <a href="https://dylanagreen.github.io/desipoint/">desipoint website</a>, which is a web based displayer for the DESI project that displays the current pointing of the telescope as well as a variety of other useful parameters.</p> <p>As part of my work in the DESC I participated in the <a href="https://github.com/LSSTDESC/tomo_challenge">tomographic binning challenge</a> which produced a paper that was published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics. My submission designed an entirely unique clustering algorithm and is outlined in a jupyter notebook in my fork of the tomographic challenge repo. I am currently considering rewriting the clustering parts of the notebook into a paper-styled note for this website, but in the meantime feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/dylanagreen/tomo_challenge/blob/master/notebooks/binning_as_clustering.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a>.</p> <p>My current work focuses on improving the Convolutional Neural Network &#40;CNN&#41; QuasarNet so that it can better identify quasars using DESI spectroscopic data. As part of this work I wrote the entirely numpy-based implementation of QuasarNet, <a href="https://github.com/desihub/QuasarNP">QuasarNP</a>, which gets run as part of the spectroscopic reduction pipeline for the DESI Survey. I am currently working on changing the QuasarNet architecture to reduce overfitting and to potentially include photo-band flux data.</p> <p>I have 5 days of in person observation experience at the Mayall 4-meter telescope, where I did work commissioning the DESI spectrographs. I have since completed an additional 8 days of remote observing on the Mayall 4-meter. I also have observing experience at Lick Observatory as part of the 2020/21 Burbidge Observational Astronomy Workshop.</p> <h2 id=publications ><a href="#publications" class=header-anchor >Publications</a></h2> <p><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0676-3661">Orcid</a></p> <ol> <li><p>Dethe, T., Gill, H., <strong>Green, D.</strong>, Greensweight, A., Gutierrez, L., He, M., Tajima, T., &amp; Yang, K. &#40;2019&#41;.
