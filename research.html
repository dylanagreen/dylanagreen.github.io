        I received my B.S. in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from the University of California, Irvine.
        As an undergraduate I joined the Kirkby lab. My research worked with all-sky images that were taken at Kitt Peak
        National Observatory. I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify clouds that were moving towards
        and over the Mayall telescope. The results of this work can be seen in my repo
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanagreen/kpno-allsky">kpno-allsky.</a>
      </p><p>
        As a graduate student I have remained in the Kirkby lab at UCI, where my current research focuses on using deep
        learning to develop data analysis pipelines. As part of the Kirkby lab I am also a part of both the Dark Energy
        Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) / Dark Energy Science
        Collaboration (DESC). My first project aimed to use deep learning to identify and flag cosmic rays that appear
        in spectroscopic images taken for the DESI Survey. Additionally I wrote and maintain the
        <a href="https://dylanagreen.github.io/desipoint/">desipoint website</a>,
        which is a web based displayer for the DESI project that displays the current pointing of the telescope as well
        as a variety of other useful parameters.
      </p><p>
        As part of my work in the DESC I participated in the
        <a href="https://github.com/LSSTDESC/tomo_challenge">tomographic binning challenge</a> which produced a paper that
        was published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics. My submission designed an entirely unique clustering algorithm
        and is outlined in a jupyter notebook in my fork of the tomographic challenge repo. I am currently considering
        rewriting the clustering parts of the notebook into a paper-styled note for this website, but in the meantime
        feel free to check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/dylanagreen/tomo_challenge/blob/master/notebooks/binning_as_clustering.ipynb"> jupyter notebook.</a>
      </p><p>
        My current work focuses on improving the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) <i>QuasarNet</i> so that it can better
        identify quasars using DESI spectroscopic data. As part of this work I wrote the entirely numpy-based implementation
        of QuasarNet, <a href=https://github.com/desihub/QuasarNP> QuasarNP</a>, which gets run as part of the
        spectroscopic reduction pipeline for the DESI Survey. I am currently working on changing the QuasarNet architecture
        to reduce overfitting and to potentially include photo-band flux data.
      </p><p>
        I have 5 days of in person observation experience at the Mayall 4-meter telescope, where I did work commissioning
        the DESI spectrographs. I have since completed an additional 4 days of remote observing on the Mayall 4-meter.
        I also have observing experience at Lick Observatory as part of the 2020/21 Burbidge
        Observational Astronomy Workshop.
