        I received my B.S. in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from the University of California, Irvine.
        As an undergraduate I joined the Kirkby lab. My research worked with all-sky images that were taken at Kitt Peak
        National Observatory. I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify clouds that were moving towards
        and over the Mayall telescope.
      </p><p>
        As a graduate student I have remained in the Kirkby lab at UCI, where my current research focuses on using deep
        learning to develop data analysis pipelines. As part of the Kirkby lab I am also a part of both the Dark Energy
        Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) / Dark Energy Science
        Comittee (DESC). My current project aims to use deep learning to identify and flag cosmic rays that appear
        in spectroscopic images taken for the DESI Survey. Additionally I wrote and maintain the
        <a href="https://dylanagreen.github.io/desipoint/">desipoint website</a>,
        which is a web based displayer for the DESI project that displays the current pointing of the telescope as well
        as a variety of other useful parameters.
      </p><p>
        I have 5 days of observation experience at the Mayall 4-meter telescope, where I did work commissioning the
        DESI spectrographs.
