## Overview
I received my B.S. in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics from the
University of California, Irvine. As an undergraduate I joined the [Kirkby lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/dkirkby/).
My research worked with all-sky images that were taken at Kitt Peak National Observatory.
I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify clouds that were
moving towards and over the Mayall telescope. The results of this work can be
seen in my repo [kpno-allsky](https://github.com/dylanagreen/kpno-allsky).

As a graduate student I have remained in the Kirkby lab at UCI,
where my current research focuses on using deep learning to develop
data analysis pipelines. As part of the Kirkby lab I am also a part of both
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and the
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) / Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).
My first project aimed to use deep learning to identify and flag cosmic rays
that appear in spectroscopic images taken for the DESI Survey.
Additionally I wrote and maintain the [desipoint website](https://dylanagreen.github.io/desipoint/),
 which is a web based displayer for the DESI project that displays the current
 pointing of the telescope as well as a variety of other useful parameters.

As part of my work in the DESC I participated in the [tomographic binning challenge](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/tomo_challenge)
which produced a paper that was published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics.
My submission designed an entirely unique clustering algorithm and is outlined
in a jupyter notebook in my fork of the tomographic challenge repo.
I am currently considering rewriting the clustering parts of the notebook into a
paper-styled note for this website, but in the meantime feel free to check out
the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dylanagreen/tomo_challenge/blob/master/notebooks/binning_as_clustering.ipynb).

My current work focuses on improving the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) QuasarNet
so that it can better identify quasars using DESI spectroscopic data.
As part of this work I wrote the entirely numpy-based implementation of QuasarNet,
[QuasarNP](https://github.com/desihub/QuasarNP), which gets run as part of the
spectroscopic reduction pipeline for the DESI Survey.
I am currently working on changing the QuasarNet architecture to reduce
overfitting and to potentially include photo-band flux data.

I have 5 days of in person observation experience at the Mayall 4-meter telescope, where I did work commissioning the DESI spectrographs. I have since completed an additional 8 days of remote observing on the Mayall 4-meter. I also have observing experience at Lick Observatory as part of the 2020/21 Burbidge Observational Astronomy Workshop.
