          My name is Dylan Green and I am a second year graduate student at the University of California, Irvine where
          I work with Professor David Kirkby studying observational cosmology.
          This is my personal website, where you can find information on my research experience, my publications, and my CV.
          There is also some information on the personal hobbies I engage in outside of my research. I hope you enjoy your stay!
        </p><p>
          The 2021 version of this website is designed using the
          <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021-palette-exploration">Orbital</a> Pantone color
          palette, which incorporates Pantone's two colors of the year: Ultimate Grey and Illuminating.
          You might notice this color choice bearing a passing resemblance to the South African Flag.
          This is no coincidence, I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and am proud of my heritage.
