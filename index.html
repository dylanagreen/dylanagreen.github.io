        My name is Dylan Green and I am a first year graduate student at the University of California, Irvine where
        I work with Professor David Kirkby.
        This is my personal website, where you can find information on my research experience, my publications, and my CV.
        There is also some information on the personal hobbies I engage in outside of my research. I hope you enjoy your stay!
