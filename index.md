 My name is Dylan Green and I am a sixth (and probably final) year graduate student at the University
 of California, Irvine where I work with Professor David Kirkby studying
 observational cosmology. This is my personal website, where you can find
 information on my research experience, my publications, and my CV. There is
 also some information on the personal hobbies I engage in outside of my research.
 I hope you enjoy your stay!

 I originally wrote this site in HTML but I have since switched to using
 Markdown and a static site generator. Currently I use [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org/)
 to generate this site.
